## ðŸ’¾ About
> The task of the FdF (fil de fer) project is to code my first graphics program using the [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42) library.

![Basic example](./example_0.png)
![Sphere example](./example_1.png)

## Requirements
* [MLX42](https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42)
* [Libft](https://github.com/kurz-m/Libft)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)

## Usage
FdF is being used by ./FDF [map.fdf] where the map is located in the [maps](./maps/) folder and has to end with a _.fdf_.
As long as all requirements are installed, a basic `make` in the root directory of [FdF](./) is sufficient. Large maps need
longer to load.

Regarding the different projections, _spherize_ is still in an experimental stage and produces interesting art when rotated.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kurz-m/FdF.git
```

```bash
cd FdF
```
```bash
make
```
```bash
./FdF [map.fdf]
```
